# 8-Puzzle
=======
How to compile and run Project 1 from command line:
1) Extract source code from compressed file.
2) Make sure java jdk is installed correctly, "java -version" to check. (Version of java I am running: java version "1.8.0_171"
                                                                            java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_171-b11)
                                                                            Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.171-b11, mixed mode))
3) Change current directory to directory where source code file is located in using "cd <path-to-directory>".                                                                             
3) To compile: "javac EightPuzzle.java".
4) To run: "java EightPuzzle".
5) The program will ask you to choose between randomizing puzzles or inputting a puzzle by typing '1' or '2'.
6a) If '1' is typed, the program will prompt the user to enter the number of randomized puzzles to test.
6b) If '2' is typed, the program will prompt the user to enter the puzzle in a sequence of unique numbers between 0-8, separating each number by a space.
7) The program will print each puzzle within a single line.
8) The program will run the list of puzzles given and print 2 lists of average search costs. One for heuristic 1 and the other for heuristic 2.

*NOTE*: Unfortunately I ran out of time programming for this project and got stuck at a bug I cannot swiftly fix (Index out of bounds exception). 
    Almost all of the code should be correctly done.
